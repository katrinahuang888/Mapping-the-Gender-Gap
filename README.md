## Introduction
> _This project was completed for a class and the code is not publicly available. I'd be happy to discuss the project in more detail or share a high-level overview  at kh107@wellesley.edu_ <br>
>To analyze the slowing fight for women’s rights in the United States, our group decided to run an experiment on the set of 50 Hollywood movies and constructed our own quantitative test (inspired by the Bechdel Test) to measure the gender imbalance in the Hollywood industry.<br>
>We believed our test to be a reasonable and meaningful one as it brings awareness about gender representation and portrayal in the film industry and creates a simple and applicable measure for various media, sparking further analyses about the quality and depth of female characters. Like the original Bechdel test, our curated Bechdel test also fails most of the 50 Hollywood casts that were provided. We hope that the results generated by our Bechdel test will impact how film watchers see the film industry, and push film producers to address these gender disparities by striving for better representation.<br>
## Collaboration
>Developing our own version of the Bechdel analysis metric was no one-person show; our group brainstormed different approaches, debated their time complexity, and ultimately refined our algorithm through feedback from professors and constant testing of code. All members of our group shared the same goals, and kept an open mind toward learning from each other and our own individual mistakes. Aiming to write code in an efficient, design-focused manner, we each shouldered and alternated roles: (1) the driver, who wrote and edited the code, (2) the navigator, who dictated code to the writer (referencing class resources or Java API), and (3) the researcher, who looked through class resources and reviewed our code for solutions to our problems.<br>
>While writing code for our project, our group ran into many problems that left us stumped, spending hours trying to solve another problem with a level of complexity seemingly even more difficult than the last. Even during these times – when morale was low, tensions were high, and we were all exhausted – everyone remained level-headed and conflict-resolute. Ultimately, this collaborative process led to a meaningful metric, our new Bechdel test, while also strengthening our understanding of a broad range of computer science principles.
